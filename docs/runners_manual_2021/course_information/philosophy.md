## 2. Philosophy

The course is designed to bring the runners into to the four major mining centers of the San Juan Mountains: Silverton, Telluride, Ouray, and Lake City, while staying as much as possible on trails and abandoned roads originally created by the miners to give the participant the maximum feeling of wilderness. As noted in the information you received with entry to this run, this course offers a graduate level challenge for endurance runs. The course is designed to provide extreme challenges in altitude, steepness, and remoteness. The extremes in altitude allow you to travel through four life zones. Care is taken to route the course so the runners exert a minimum impact on the environment. 

Mountaineering, wilderness survival and wilderness navigation skills are as important in this event as your endurance. The remoteness and wild nature of the course have dictated that Charlie Thorn, Course Marking Director, and I use a different marking approach than you may have encountered at other runs. **We expect the individual runners to have enough knowledge about the course that they can follow it without markers. You need to decide how to best equip yourself to meet this requirement. Methods that others have used include spending as much time as possible on the course before the run, possibly with the group that installs the markers, or relying on the written description and maps along with their navigation skills.** The markers we do put into the field should be considered as minimal navigation aids. For first time runners who are used to courses that are marked with a nearly continuous set of ribbons and/or glow sticks from start to finish, be prepared to change your expectations. There are sections where the runner will go for several miles without seeing a marker. We will elaborate more on marking later. 

**Each entrant must be willing to accept individual responsibility for being able to negotiate the course regardless of number or location of markers.**
