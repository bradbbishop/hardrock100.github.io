## 1. Introduction

In this section of the runners package we will briefly discuss the philosophy for the routing and marking of the course, review the course dedication, present some general information about the places along the course, discuss course marking to reinforce what is already put into the package, review the history of the course since the start of the Hardrock run, and present a detailed description of the course for the clockwise direction.
