## 1. Introduction and Run Organization

Welcome to the twenty-fifth running of the Hardrock Hundred! The Hardrock was thought up by Gordon Hardman as a tribute
to the old time miners who followed their mules and instincts, prospecting the San Juans for gold, silver, and other
metals. These miners endured cold, snow and avalanches, hunger, mining accidents, and a host of other hazards that we,
todayâ€™s Hardrocker runners, have difficulty imagining. The miners enjoyed the immense beauty of the San Juans regardless
of the risks. Now, in 2018, more than 140 years after the San Juan mineral quest began, we have the opportunity to enjoy
the beauty and, compared to the old timers, experience a small amount of risk and effort. Enjoy it and respect it.

This manual provides Hardrock Hundred runners and their crews with information to help in preparing for the 2018 run
weekend and the run. We want to improve all aspects of the run, so please make notes (possibly mark up your manual and
return it to Charlie Thorn) so that it can be improved for next year.

At the center of all run organization is the Run Director (RD), Dale Garland. He has authority for all activities during
the run and will work to ensure it goes smoothly. At all times during the run, he or his designee can be reached via the
Amateur Radio Network or in person at the Start/Finish in the Silverton High School gym, located at 12th Street and
Reese near downtown Silverton.

Travel in the mountains is difficult - please try to solve problems locally, but contact the RD immediately when local
solutions don't seem to be working. The RD has final authority on any question that may arise during this event. Prior
to the run you can contact him at the addresses or numbers found in the Contact List.
