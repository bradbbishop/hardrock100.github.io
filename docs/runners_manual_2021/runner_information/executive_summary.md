## Executive Rules Summary

We hope you read this manual in its entirety. But here is a summary of what we think are the important points! It is our
goal to provide you a safe, well-organized and spectacular running experience. In order to do this we ask that you help
us by abiding by these guidelines.

1. No Whining.
2. The Run Director has final authority on any question that may arise during the HRH.
3. You must leave each aid station by the posted cutoff time. If you return, it will be assumed you have abandoned your
   run attempt.
4. No littering.
5. No stashing of supplies along the course and no accepting aid except within 400 yards of a designated aid station.
6. You have agreed to be pulled for medical and safety reasons if it is determined that such action is in your best
   interest.
7. Aid Station Captains have the authority to act on behalf of the HRH run management.
8. Enjoy yourself!!!!!
9. Pacers may meet their runner at **CREW ACCESS AID STATIONS ONLY** with two exceptions 1) for the CW direction, pacers
   are allowed to start pacing at Maggie if they hike in to the aid station on their own. 2) for the CCW years, pacers
   are allowed to start at KT if they hike in to the aid station on their own.
10. Parking restrictions apply. See Section 4.2 of this manual.
11. You must kiss the **HARDROCK** upon your successful completion of the run.
