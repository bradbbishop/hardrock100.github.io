This is a GitHub Pages site for manuals and other documentation related to the Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run. 

The website is located at https://hardrock100.github.io

### Additions and Changes

Make additions and changes to the site by submitting a Pull Request. You can do this directly from
GitHub by following these steps:

1. You can't make changes directly to the master branch, so first you'll need to make a new branch. 
Follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch) to make a new branch.

2. Add or edit files [like this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository). 

3. Commit your changes.

4. If you need to add an image, [upload it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) and again commit changes.

5. Go back to the main repository page and make a Pull Request.

6. Name your Pull Request and submit it.

7. Ask another collaborator to review and approve your changes.

8. Once your Pull Request is approved, merge it into the master branch.

Once merged, your branch will be automatically deleted.

9. Within a short time (generally 30 to 60 seconds) your changes should be available on the site. 
   Verify things look how you expected. If anything doesn't look right, repeat the above steps and fix it.
